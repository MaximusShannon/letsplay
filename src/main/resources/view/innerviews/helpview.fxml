It helps you find friends that have similar requirements/settings to you. But I haven't seen anything on the home page you ask? That's because you have not configured you matchmaker settings. You can do this by using the settings tab. It is located down the bottom of the mainview page. Once you have completed your configuration you will then start seeing people the next time you log in. (Or maybe not, maybe nobody will match you initially, but as we grow in size im sure your perfect match will come)" wrappingWidth="815.564453125">

The whole reason this tool was created was to allow the user to tailor their specific needs and try convey it in a simple format. You can set such things as, the post title: &quot;Hey guys lets play Rust tonight&quot;, &quot;Hey guys lets go for this acheivement on Counter Strike&quot;. We are totally leaving this up to the user what they want to do. You can also set a description on your post, try and give as much information on what you are doing in the online world, this also supports the game choice. Initially we have just a few games listed but as we grow there will be more support added for each game. Down the bottom of the post creation screen you will see you requirements, this allows you to tailor your post to your specific needs. What are you waiting for?
