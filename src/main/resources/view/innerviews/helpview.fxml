It helps you find friends that have similar requirements/settings to you. But I haven't seen anything on the home page you ask? That's because you have not configured you matchmaker settings. You can do this by using the settings tab. It is located down the bottom of the mainview page. Once you have completed your configuration you will then start seeing people the next time you log in. (Or maybe not, maybe nobody will match you initially, but as we grow in size im sure your perfect match will come)" wrappingWidth="815.564453125">
